## Test Instructions

### Technology Options:

**HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript:**

- You can choose a pure web development approach using HTML5, CSS3, and
vanilla JavaScript.
- Ensure that animations, responsiveness, and performance optimization are
implemented effectively.

**React:**

- Build a Single Page Application (SPA) using React.
- Focus on component reusability and SEO optimization (e.g., using
react-helmet for meta tags).

**Next.js:**

- Utilize server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG).

- Ensure that your implementation improves performance and SEO with built-in
Next.js features.

### Must-Have Features:

**Design Implementation:**

- Translate the Figma design into an actual user interface.
- Ensure the design is fully responsive and looks good on all screen sizes.

**Animations:**

- Add CSS3 animations, or use libraries like GSAP or Framer Motion.
- Focus on animations such as text reveal or fade-in effects to enhance the user
experience without overwhelming it.

**SEO Optimization:**

- Implement proper SEO techniques, such as meta tags, semantic HTML, and
optimized loading times.

**Performance:**

- The final output should be lightweight and have fast loading times. Use lazy
loading and other performance techniques where necessary.


### Evaluation Criteria:

You will be assessed on the following aspects:

**Design & UX:**

- Adherence to the Figma design and delivering a visually appealing and
user-friendly interface.
- Smooth, well-integrated animations that enhance the experience.

**Technical Implementation:**

- Effective use of React, Next.js, or HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
- Proper componentization (if using React or Next.js) and SEO optimization.
- Seamless integration of animations and smooth transitions.

**Performance & SEO:**

- Ensure fast load times, efficient rendering, and SEO-friendly code.
- Meta tags and proper semantic HTML are essential.


**Attention to Detail:**

- A comprehensive approach to technical and design details will be critical.
- Ensure that all aspects of the test have been addressed before submission.

### Submission Guidelines

- Create a GitHub repository and commit your code there.
- Share the repository link with us once it is completed.
- A README is required. If we donâ€™t have a README, your test will be
ignored.
- You can upload a video or provide a URL showing the project's progress.
Please share it with a public link.
