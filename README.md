## Test Instructions

### Technology Options:

**HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript:**

- You can choose a pure web development approach using HTML5, CSS3, and
vanilla JavaScript.
- Ensure that animations, responsiveness, and performance optimization are
implemented effectively.

**React:**

- Build a Single Page Application (SPA) using React.
- Focus on component reusability and SEO optimization (e.g., using
react-helmet for meta tags).

**Next.js:**

- Utilize server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG).

- Ensure that your implementation improves performance and SEO with built-in
Next.js features.

### Must-Have Features:

**Design Implementation:**

- Translate the Figma design into an actual user interface.
- Ensure the design is fully responsive and looks good on all screen sizes.

**Animations:**

- Add CSS3 animations, or use libraries like GSAP or Framer Motion.
- Focus on animations such as text reveal or fade-in effects to enhance the user
experience without overwhelming it.

**SEO Optimization:**

- Implement proper SEO techniques, such as meta tags, semantic HTML, and
optimized loading times.

**Performance:**

- The final output should be lightweight and have fast loading times. Use lazy
loading and other performance techniques where necessary.


### Evaluation Criteria:

You will be assessed on the following aspects:

**Design & UX:**

- Adherence to the Figma design and delivering a visually appealing and
user-friendly interface.
- Smooth, well-integrated animations that enhance the experience.

**Technical Implementation:**

- Effective use of React, Next.js, or HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
- Proper componentization (if using React or Next.js) and SEO optimization.
- Seamless integration of animations and smooth transitions.

**Performance & SEO:**

- Ensure fast load times, efficient rendering, and SEO-friendly code.
- Meta tags and proper semantic HTML are essential.


**Attention to Detail:**

- A comprehensive approach to technical and design details will be critical.
- Ensure that all aspects of the test have been addressed before submission.

### Submission Guidelines

- Create a GitHub repository and commit your code there.
- Share the repository link with us once it is completed.
- A README is required. If we donâ€™t have a README, your test will be
ignored.
- You can upload a video or provide a URL showing the project's progress.
Please share it with a public link.

## Development and application ![vscode](https://img.shields.io/badge/VSCode-0078D4?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual%20studio%20code&logoColor=white)

### Technology Options:

- For this project, I chose Next.js, a strategic choice that allowed me to leverage its constant evolution and the vast array of tools and technologies it offers. The implementation was carried out using static site generation (SSG), ensuring fast and optimized loading for the user.
  
- The project implements componentization, with a separation of the page into individual sections. Each section was carefully developed and tested independently, using Jest for both individual component testing and integration testing with other components.

### Design Implementation:

- The entire design was crafted with user experience in mind. Subtle hover effects provide clear visual feedback for interactions, while meticulously adhering to the provided Figma design and maintaining the brand identity throughout.

- The website boasts full responsiveness, achieved through a combination of clever techniques. Text and sizing utilize variables, dynamically adjusting with clamp() and calc() functions. Strategic media query breakpoints ensure optimal layout across a range of devices, resulting in a seamless user experience regardless of screen size.}

### Animation:

- For an engaging and dynamic visual experience, animations are implemented using the react-animate-on-scroll library. This approach ensures smooth and seamless integration of animations, enhancing the user experience as they scroll through the site.

- The animation effects chosen were carefully selected for their impact. The banner utilizes a simple fade-in effect, while other elements feature engaging side-slides and zoom-in/zoom-up transitions. This creates a dynamic and visually appealing experience. To ensure optimal performance and avoid unnecessary overhead, each animation is triggered only once per page load.

### SEO Optimization:

SEO best practices were implemented throughout the project, taking inspiration from Google's recommendations. Key elements within layout.tsx include:

- **Optimized Title and Description:** The page utilizes a complete title incorporating the brand name "Soller" and a compelling tagline, "Your power of the sun." The description incorporates relevant keywords to enhance search visibility.

- **Open Graph Integration:** Open Graph metadata is included to ensure proper sharing across social media platforms.

- **robots.txt Configuration:** The robots.txt file is configured to guide search engines and improve indexing.

- **Favicon Implementation:** The Soller brand favicon is implemented for a professional touch.

### Performance:

Rigorous testing was conducted to ensure optimal integration, performance, and overall user experience. The Chrome Lighthouse panel provided valuable insights into website performance, while Jest was utilized for code-level testing, guaranteeing code quality and functionality.

- **Results**

- **Lighthouse: ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lighthouse-F44B21?style=for-the-badge&logo=Lighthouse&logoColor=white)**

*ps: While the project received a high score for accessibility, a minor deduction of 4 points was incurred due to the choice of yellow for the input text within the sections.
